<li>AP students earn college <i>credit by exam</i> for qualifying exam scores
</li>
<li>AP courses are taught by high school teachers, not college instructors</li>
<li>The AP curriculum is <i>prescribed</i> by the College Board</li>
<li>DE students are <i>in</i> college classes</li>
<li>DE classes are taught by qualified college instructors</li>
<li>DE students earn college credit directly from the course, not from a
single exam</li>

<h2>Challenges of Being a DE Teacher</h2>
<ul>
<li>You serve not one bureaucratic overlord, <i>but two</i>! (and they
often don't communicate well with each other)</li>
<li>The above fact can potentially lead to <i>a lot</i> of extra workload.</li>
<li>It also leads to <i>a lot</i> of extra credentialling requirements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rewards of Being a DE Teacher</h2>
<p>
Personally, the joy I get from being a DE teacher is the main thing keeping
me at retirement age from wanting to retire. I think that joy stems mostly
from the increased academic freedom and creativity allowed me as a college
instructor. I love planning curriculum and adapting it in real time to the
needs of my students. As a DE teacher, I feel I can do that.

<p>
In speaking with SLA teachers during my visit here, I realized what I get out
of being a DE teacher is similar to what the teachers here get from being in
the SLA learning environment - the opportunity to both collaborate with the
communitiy on shared goals and express their humanity through their classroom
activities.
